# Backend Coding Challenge

A common method of organizing files on a computer is to store them in hierarchical directories.

## Documentation

### Running

This project uses TypeScript, but it has already been compiled for use. You need to add a command file in the command folder. There is already a command0.txt file with example commands from the coding challenge that you can use as follows:

`npm run start command0.txt`

For new files added, use:

`npm run start [name of command file]`

### Testing

`npm run test`
