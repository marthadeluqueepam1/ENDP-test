### Running

This project uses typescript but it is already compiled to be used.
It is needed to add a command file in the command folder. There is a command0.txt file already with the example commands in the coding challenge ready to use as:

`npm run start command0.txt`

or for new fields added:

`npm run start [name of command file]`

### Testing

`npm run test`
